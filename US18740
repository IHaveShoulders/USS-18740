<----REQUIREMENTS---->

- Prompt user for username and password.
- Ask user for number of students, test max. score, score threshold
- Ask user to list each student's score.

- Program needs to calculate:
-- Total scores (sum of all scores)
-- Average score (sum of all scores over amount of scores)
-- Average score rounded
-- Average score percentage ((sum of all scores over (max. score times amount of scores)) times one hundred)
-- Average score percentage rounded
-- Threshold met y/n (if av. percent >= threshold, true. else, false.)
